            <h3>Our Vision</h3>
            <p>To be cliche about it, we want to make the world a better place.  We have seen the power of self-monitoring firsthand, and the powerful ways that it can help improve health.  We see the adoption of wearable devices and mobile health apps exploding.</p>
            <p>What we don't see is a clear, unified, and secure way to pull data together and gain actionable insight.  We believe that people should be able to own their data, especially when it is this sensitive.</p>
            <p>The collaborative and open source nature of Realize is a product of this vision.  We hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoy making it.  If you ever want to peek at the code, check it out <a href="http://www.github.com/realizeapp/realize-core">here</a>.</p>
